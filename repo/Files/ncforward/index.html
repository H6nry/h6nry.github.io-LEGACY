Should be compatible with iOS 5.0 - 8.x<br><br>
NCForward lets you forward your iOS notifications to ANY other device.
Currently, Windows is supported, Mac and Linux are not.<br>
You will need to run <a href="http://h6nry.github.io/Files/NCForward1.exe" target="blank_">this program</a> on your Windows computer
to forward your notifications within your LAN.<br>
To forward your notifications to Pushbullet devices, sign in to Pushbullet in settings.<br>
