Should be compatible with iOS 5.0 - 8.x<br><br>
NCForward lets you forward your iOS notifications to ANY other device in your local network (LAN/WLAN).
Currently, Windows is supported, Mac and Linux are not.<br>
You will need to run <a href="http://h6nry.github.io/Files/NCForward1.exe" target="blank_">this program</a> on your Windows computer
to make this tweak usable. For further information and documentation read here: <a href="http://h6nry.github.io/ncforward.html">NCForward - Forward your notifications</a><br><br>
<b>New in Version 1.1</b><br>
- Eventually updated iOS 8+ support :)<br>
